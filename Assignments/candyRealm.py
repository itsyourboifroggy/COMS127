    # TODO: Program the game of 'Candy Realm!' You may accomplish this however you like outside of using ChatGPT/ AI code generation/ cheating.
    #       Your submission should generally follow the rules of the original game (found below).
    #       Your submission should visualize the game in some way - meaning that the user should be able to see the pieces/ board.
    #       You can have 'wildcards,' 'extra rules,' 'double drawing cards,' and basically anything else you want! Use your imagination!
